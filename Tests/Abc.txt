Touch typing is the ability to use muscle memory to find keys fast,
without using the sense of sight, and with all the available fingers, just like piano players do.
It significantly improves typing speed and eliminates errors.
Touch typing simply makes you more productive and it is a skill worth learning.
However, many people engage in the bad habit of
"hunt-and-peck" typing, even those seasoned
professionals with years and decades of computer experience. It is easy to understand, though,
as touch typing requires dedicated practice to learn it well.
